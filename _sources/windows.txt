Install Python (may not be needed)
------------------------------------

.. warning:: python may come with cygwin and this may therefor be
	     uneccesarry. This needs to be investigated, and possibley
	     this sectin needs to be removed.
	     
Python can be found at http://www.python.org. We recommend to download
and install the newest version of python. At this time we recommend
that you use version 2.7.10. Other versions may work to, but are not
supported or tested. A direct link to the install can be found at

* https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi

In powershell you can type::

  explorer https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi

Thsi will open the Windows explorer, download the msi and ask you to
install it.

Once downloaded, open it by clicking on the downloaded file. You may
also want to change the properties and add python to the path

Install Cygwin
---------------

We install cygwin via chocolatey. To do so you first have to start a
power shell as adminstrator with::

  PS> Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs

Allow execution of scripts::

  PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  
Next execute the command to install chocolatey::
  
  PS> iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

Unset the script execution permission::
  
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
  
Next execute in cmd.exe::
  
  choco install --force -y cygwin 
 
Note: if Cygwin is already installed, --force will reinstall it.

Install apt-cyg
---------------

Now open cygwin window by clicking on the desktop icon. Put the
following command into Cygwin terminal (its shorcut can be found on
your Desktop)::
  
  lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
  install apt-cyg /bin

This will give you a nice command to add additional packages to cygwin
without using the cygwin GUI. You will also want the following appliations::

  apt-cyg install wget
  apt-cyg install emacs
  apt-cyg install git
  apt-cyg install curl
  apt-cyg install nc
  apt-cyg install make
  apt-cyg install gcc-g++ diffutils libmpfr-devel libgmp-devel libmpc-devel
  apt-cyg install db

Using cygwin
-------------

When starting a new powershell terminal you can simply typ into it::

  cygwin

This way you can easily past and copy into the cywin terminal that is
started via powershell. This is extremly useful if you run Windows in
a virtual server and want to easily past and copy strings to and from
the host operating system. In virtualbox you maus enable past frm
clipboard in bidirectional mode.


Makeing python usable
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To test if you have the right version of python execute::

  python --version

which should return 2.7.10 and::

  pip --version

You might see version 7.0.1 in which case you should update with::

  pip install -U pip 

.. note:: the update may not work as some error is reported. This
	  needs to be investigated and a workaround needs to be found.

We want also to install virtualenv::

  pip install virtualenv
