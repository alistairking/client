Cloudmesh Client Toolkit
============================================

The *cloudmesh client* toolkit is a lightweight client interface of
accessing heterogeneous clouds, clusters, and workstations right from
the users computer.  The user can manage his own set of resources he
would like to utilize. Thus the user has the freedom to customize
their cyber infrastructure they use.  Cloudmesh client includes an
API, a commandline client, and a commandline shell.  It strives to
abstract backends to databases that are used to manage the workflow
utilizing the different infrastructure and also the
services. Switching for example to stage virtual machines from
openstack clouds to amazon is as simple as specifying the name of the
cloud. Moreover, cloudmesh client can be installed on Linux, MacOSX,
and even Windows. Currently we support backends to SLURM, SSH,
Openstack, Heat. In the past we supported AWS and Azure. We are in the
process of integrating them back into the client.
