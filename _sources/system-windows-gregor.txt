Gregors Windows install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install chocolatey::

  Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

Restart the administrative shell so you can use choco

In adminstrative new power shell Install Gnu on windows::

  choco install gow -y --force
  choco install git.commandline -y
  
Restart a new powershell window to use the commands

In non administrative shell

mkdir $HOME/.ssh.

Remember to always use $HOME instead of ~ as commands such as ssh, and sshkeygen do not use ~

ssh-keygen -f $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa

Next you can ssh into the machine like this

   ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa gvonlasz@india.futuregrid.org

Note that a login without the -i seems not to work
