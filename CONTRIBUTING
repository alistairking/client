Contributing
==================================================

Here will be the contributing guidelines

* use pycharm for editing
* use Code Inspect regularly on the files you modify and fix the sensible pip8 warnings.
  Look at other warnings and errors

* use .format instead of % in print
* use from __future__ import print_function at the beginning of the file and use
    print("msg") instead of print msg

* use as much python 3 like code developed in python 2
* use class name(object): and not just class name:

* use Console.error when printing errors if you develop a command for the commandline

* use ConfigDict when reading yaml files
