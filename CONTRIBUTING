The project is open source and if you like you can help. 

Here are some contribution guidelines:

* we use the Apache 2.0 licence

* use pycharm for editing

* use ``Code Inspect`` regularly on the files you modify and fix the sensible pep8 warnings.
  Look at other warnings and errors

* use ``.format`` instead of ``%`` in print

* use ``from __future__ import print_function`` at the beginning of the file and use
  ``print("msg")`` instead of ``print msg``

* use as much python 3 like code developed in python 2

* use ``class name(object):`` and not just ``class name:``

* use ``Console.error`` when printing errors if you develop a command for the commandline

* use ``ConfigDict`` when reading yaml files

* use nose tests for testing your programs

  An example is provided in ``tests/test_sample.py``::

    nosetests -v --nocapture tests/test_sample.py

  you can copy this to ``tests/test_yourfile.py`` and then replace in
  that file the occurance of ``_sample`` with ``_yourfile``

  make sure to create meaningful tests.

* the documentation is writte in RST http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html
