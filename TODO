A) FIX cm key upload

cm key load

    will generate id_rsa in keys

cm key upload

   will find id_rsa and upload to cloud with name

   <username>-key

    right now it uploads only if you specify the keyname

    cm key upload id_rsa

    its inconvenient to even think about the naming

    if the key id_rsa does not exists the first key in the db will be used,
    if no key is in the db a nice error msg should be printed
    no exception ...

B)
